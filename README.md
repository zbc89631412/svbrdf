This is a team project, the report introduces what this project is about and analyses the results using metrics RMSE and LPIPS  
The final.ipynb is the helper that crop the input of three models.
The link of three papers:
https://github.com/valentin-deschaintre/Single-Image-SVBRDF-Capture-rendering-loss
https://github.com/msraig/DeepInverseRendering
https://people.engr.tamu.edu/nimak/Papers/EG2021_SVBRDF/index.html
